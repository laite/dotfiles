						Developing web page is a tedious task. Not only should one pay attention on the contents, but also the visual design, user experience and the quality of code.
					</p>
					<p>
						This page is a minute approach to Web Design, where I try to talk about some general principles and pointers for creating a 
							<a href="glossary.html#goodwebsite">good web site</a>
						. Everything on this page is to be treated as a <em>personal opinion</em>, since I have no real education on the subject.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have included a small 
							<a href="glossary.html">glossary</a> 
						for some problematic terms or just to add some advanced discussion without disrupting the 
							<a href="glossary.html#userexperience">user experience</a> 
						in the current page. There are also some 
							<a href="glossary.html#Links">external links</a> 
						about the subject.

					<p>There are some General Principles that every good web developer should take into account. Not only should web designer try to create a stunning, visually appealing page, he/she must also be able to create it so that people who have never seen the page before would immediately feel at ease with it.</p>

					<p>
					Gestalt design laws are a set of principles that can be used as a framework when designing <a href="glossary.html#userinterface">user interfaces</a>. Few of the most common are listed here.
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Closure:</strong> the mind supplies the missing pieces in a composition</li>
							<li><strong>Continuance:</strong> the eye continues in the direction it is going</li>
							<li><strong>Similarity:</strong> what an items looks like and how that effects gestalt</li>
							<li><strong>Proximity:</strong> where items are in relationship to each other and how that effects gestalt</li>
							<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> lining up objects to organize and form groups</li>

						Of course, Gestalt is just the beginning. Cue laws of Klinga.
						<ul>
							<li>There is nothing wrong with boring</li>

							<li>Content is always more important than you think</li>

					<p>
					Web usability could be described as 'get out of my way' - people do not want to <em>use</em> web pages, they want to click largest, brightest button and recieve the exact information they're looking for (preferably with super cool audiovisual effect storm, but that's another story).
					</p>

			<div class="paraContainer">
				<aside class="sidebar">Some Do's and Dont's</aside>
				<section class="content">
					<p>
						These are some things that one should consider before/while creating wep pages.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Who are you designing for</h4>
							<p>
							It's quite different to create web page for your local boyscout branch or eager, yet narrowminded advertisement company. Designer <strong>must know the audience</strong> and write to them.
							</p>
						<li>
							<h4>Style vs. usability</h4>
							<p>
							Some web pages are so cool they throw usability straight to hell. "Colored links? Bah. Let's have more cyb0rkittahs instead."
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Users are always busy</h4>
							<p>
							Walls of text have a bad reputation. For some reason users in the Internet have practically no time at all to read things. They want everything instantly or they move away. If you really want to write, make sure that your page is serene, peaceful and well structured so <em>nothing</em> takes away users attention. It also helps if you actually have <a href="glossary.html#somethingtosay">something to say</a>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Users know better</h4>
							<p>
							Whatever you do, it's probably wrong. So don't be afraid to <del>copy</del> draw inspiration from the most popular web sites in the world - that's how people mostly 'use their Internet' anyway and that's how they expect things to work.
							</p>
						</li>

				</aside>
				<section class="content">
				<p style="color: #c44;">
				NOTE: These tips are taken from <em>Research-Based Web Design & Usability Guidelines</em> and seem a bit outdated.

			<div class="paraContainer">
				<aside class="sidebar">The Homepage</aside>
				<section class="content">
					<p>
						The homepage can invite or turn away; usually one can instantly see whether he/she likes or hates the service he/she has stumbled upon. First impression is crucial.
					</p>
					<p>
						Generally The Homepage should be source for latest news (shortly) and a portal to all the important services on the site. Large promotion images / offers are usually allowed and tolerated.
					</p>
				</section>
			</div>

			<div class="paraContainer">
				<aside class="sidebar">Page Layout</aside>
				<section class="content">
					<p>
						It's probably a good idea to put important things first on page, or at least include page-specific Table of Contents if there's a lot of text or other items. One should also pay attention to the length of lines and paragraphs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Main focus should always be on readability and overall clarity of layout; do not try to have too much things on the same page. Be consistent. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Despite <em>Research-based Web Design...</em> I would say that there is usually nothing wrong with having much white space on layout - as long as the main content fulfills Gestalt idea of proximity. Obviously this depends a whole lot on the overall layout.
					</p>

			<div class="paraContainer">
				<aside class="sidebar">Navigation</aside>
				<section class="content">
					<p>Be very cautious with opening new browser windows - it's usually really annoying and unnecessary. If possible, user should always be able to use browser's 'back' button to return from last link (many javascripts break this)</p>
					<p>Use anchor links on long web pages. It's usually a good idea to put high level links on topmost or at left side of screen and lower level under/beside them. Page should also always give user simple feedbak about where he/she is currently.</p>
					<p>One shouldn't create any "navigation-only" type pages, there are a lot of better ways to implement this kind of navigation (unless there's a <em>lot</em> of different links, see e.g. <a href="http://www.debian.org/sitemap">debian.org sitemap</a>).</p>
					<p>Site maps as such are (IMO) a bit old-fashioned, and it would be better to categorize site so that they wouldn't be even needed. Obviously this is not always possible. Breadcrumb Navigation is great alternative!</p>

			<div class="paraContainer">
				<aside class="sidebar">Headings etc.</aside>
				<section class="content">
					<p>Don't dismiss page titles, use unique and clear headings.</p>
					<p>Categorize elements on the page and use different levels for headers accordingly.</p>

				<aside class="sidebar">Text Appearance</aside>
				<section class="content">
				<p>Don't go wild with the fonts. Stay with the basic sans or sans-serif. Make sure there is always enough contrast between text and background. Format similar items consistently.</p>
				<p>Embhasizing things is a good thing, but only if it's used sparingly.</p>
				</section>
			</div>

			<div class="paraContainer">
				<aside class="sidebar">Graphics And Multimedia</aside>
				<section class="content">
				<p>Use images sparingly, consistently and without disturbing the overall experience. One should be really careful about videos/flash - animations. And <strong>never</strong> start any audio without asking user.</p>
				<p>Actual (research etc.) data is usually nice to have as a visual element. It's usually safe to have graphical elements resemble real world, so users know immediately their purpose.</p>
				<p>Even though bandwidths tend to be quite large these days, there's nothing wrong in providing thumbnail-sized images when it's not necessary to load whole large one.</p>
